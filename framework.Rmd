# Creating The "Schedule" Of Subject Observations 

```{r}
# Function for creating backbone for data of an N-of-1 trial
create.backbone = function(order = c("A", "B"), s.freq = 1, 
                           p.length = 1, n.blocks = 1) {
  # Parameters
  # - order: the order that the treatments appear in
  # - s.freq: sampling frequency, how many times a patient will be measured in a 
  #           given treatment period
  # - p.length: period length
  # - n.blocks: how many treatment blocks there are
  
  # Working Assumptions
  # - Assumes that we will only be working with two treatments 
  
  # Build out a block skeleton detailing the treatment schedule for the subject
  single.block = tibble(
    treatment = rep(order, each = s.freq * p.length)
  )
  
  # Append this data structure to itself repeatedly
  all.blocks = NULL
  for (i in 1:n.blocks) {
    all.blocks = bind_rows(all.blocks, single.block)
  }
  
  # Correctly label day of trial and treatment blocks
  all.blocks = all.blocks %>% 
    mutate(
      block = rep(1:n.blocks, each = s.freq * p.length * length(order)),
      day = rep(1:(n.blocks * p.length * length(order)), each = s.freq)
    )
  
  return(all.blocks)
}

# Confirming this works
# Sampling once a day, each treatment period is only one day, 3 blocks...
bb = create.backbone(order = c("A", "B",), 
                    s.freq = 1, p.length = 1, n.blocks = 3)
kable(head(bb))
```

With a schedule of treatments and periods down, we can start to model the carryover and run-in effects. First, we need a proper representation of the different treatments.

# Treatment Objects 

There are three things that we need to know from a treatment:

- its actual effect on the outcome of interest
- the time needed for its effect to completely go away (carry over)
- the time needed for it to reach its full effect (run-in)

```{r}
# Treatment that reduces outcome by 23 points, 2 days to ramp up, 3 days to die
trt.A = list(
  name = "A",
  effect = -30,
  sd = 1,
  run = 2,
  carry = 3
)

trt.B = list(
  name = "B",
  effect = -50,
  sd = 1,
  run = 4,
  carry = 2
)

trt.C = list(
  name = "C",
  effect = -10,
  sd = 1,
  run = 5,
  carry = 9
)

trt.D = list(
  name = "D",
  effect = -20,
  sd = 1,
  run = 10,
  carry = 1
)

placebo = list(
  name = "D",
  effect = 0,
  sd = 1,
  run = 10,
  carry = 1
)
```

We'll need a way to correctly capture when a treatment has carryover/run-in and when to have instantaneous effects.

# Modeling Treatment Effects 

```{r}
expdecay = function(start, target, tau, delta_t) {
  # Parameters
  # - start: the value we want to start at
  # - target: the value we want to end up at after all delta_t
  # - tau: scalar factor for how fast the decay happens (related to carryover, run-in)
  # - delta_t: vector of numbers to calculate the transition
  
  # Returns
  # - a vector of values going from a start value to a target value in a decay fashion
  
  # Notes:
  # if the decay profile doesn't seem correct, just tune it to your liking
  
  target + (start - target) * exp(-delta_t / tau)
}

data1 = tibble(
  x = 1:20,
  y = expdecay(0, all.trts$A$effect, all.trts[["A"]]$run, x),
)

ggplot(data1, aes(x = x, y = y)) +
  geom_line(color = "red") 
```

```{r}
# Function for finding intervals of being in a given treatment
collect.intervals = function(trt, trt.vec, type = "run") {
  # Parameters
  # - trt: the given treatment you want to find the treatment intervals for
  # - trt.vec: the vector of treatments
  # - match: do we want to see when the treatment is being used (TRUE) or not being used (FALSE)
  
  n = length(trt.vec)
  all.indices = c()
  matched = ifelse(type == "run", TRUE, FALSE)
  indices = integer()
  
  for (i in 1:n) {
    match = (trt.vec[i] == trt)
    # The character matches the current index in the treatment vector
    # Add the index
    if (match == matched) {
      indices = c(indices, i)
    }
    
    # Edge case for capturing treatments at the end
    if (match == matched & i == n) {
      indices = c(indices, i)
      all.indices = rbind(all.indices, c(min(indices), max(indices)))
    }

    # This signifies that there was a change in treatment
    # We should reset everything in preparation for seeing the treatment again
